# Portfolio App

This repo has 3 apps:
- REST Server with endpoints to get data on portfolios and the securities in the portfolios
- Kafka Producer sends out stock information from IEX to topic 'securities'
- Kafka Consumer consumes the stock data and sends it out to a websocket so that [this web app](https://github.com/andrepimenta10/portfolio-app) can listen to the information 

This is a simple demo app. Kafka streams are great for when there are multiple applications listening to events/messages. For example, other servers could be consuming the messages.
